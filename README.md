# Fiori Programming Model Analyzer for S/4HANA ‚Äì ABAP Generator

This repository contains the **ABAP generator** component of the [Fiori Programming Model Analyzer](https://github.com/alespad/s4-fiori-model-analyzer) project.


üìù **SAP Community Blog Post:** [Is It RAP or BOPF? Fiori Programming Model Analyzer for S/4HANA](https://community.sap.com/)


## Overview

The **ABAP generator** analyzes both **standard and custom Fiori apps** on your S/4HANA system and automatically classifies them based on key technical indicators:

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Programming Model** | RAP, BOPF, or N/A (Gateway Classic) |
| **Business Entity** | Root CDS view or Business Object name |
| **OData Version** | V2 or V4 |
| **Service Information** | Service name, URI, SEGW project |
| **FPM Extensions** | Whether the app uses Flexible Programming Model extensions |

The analyzer reads each app‚Äôs `manifest.json`, cross-references it with DDL sources and Service Definitions, and generates **JSON** and **CSV** outputs for visualization using the [viewer application](https://github.com/alespad/s4-fiori-model-analyzer).

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository  
2. **Import the ABAP objects** into your S/4HANA system using [abapGit](https://abapgit.org) or your preferred method  
3. **Activate all objects**

# Usage
## for Standard SAP Fiori Apps

### Report: `Z_FIORI_MODEL_GENERATOR`

The analyzer requires an input **CSV file** exported from the [SAP Fiori Apps Reference Library](https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/).

### Option 1: Export from SAP Fiori Library

1. Go to the **SAP Fiori Apps Reference Library**  
2. Filter by your **S/4HANA version**  
3. Export the **catalog as CSV**

**Required columns:**
- `FioriId`
- `AppName`
- `BSPName`
- `Link`

> Column order doesn‚Äôt matter.  
> OData service information is *not* required ‚Äî it will be extracted automatically from the `manifest.json`.

### Option 2: Use Pre-exported Data

You can also download **ready-to-use CSV files** from the [Viewer Project](https://github.com/alespad/s4-fiori-model-analyzer/tree/main/docs/data). FioriLibraryExport_*.csv

### Report Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Import File** | Path to your CSV file (e.g. `/tmp/fiori_apps.csv`) |
| **Filter by IDs (optional)** | Comma-separated list of Fiori IDs to analyze specific apps |
| **Execute on Local or Server** | Choose execution mode |


### üì§ Output

The report generates both **JSON** and **CSV** files, which can be:

- **Visualized** locally using the [Viewer Application](https://github.com/alespad/s4-fiori-model-analyzer)  
 ‚Üí See [*‚ÄúUsing Your Own Data‚Äù*](https://github.com/alespad/s4-fiori-model-analyzer?tab=readme-ov-file#using-your-own-data) section in the viewer repository.
- **Contributed** back to the main project via Pull Request  
  ‚Üí Update `sources.json` and add your CSV/JSON files  
  ‚Üí Help expand coverage for additional **S/4HANA releases**

## for Analyzing Custom Fiori Apps
Coming Soon - Support for analyzing custom BSP Fiori applications deployed on your system.

## How it Works (Technical Overview)
The analyzer uses two main ABAP classes to determine the programming model behind Fiori apps:
### Class ZCL_FIORI_MODEL_MANIFEST
This class is responsible for extracting information from the app's manifest.json file. Important note: The manifest is NOT parsed into JSON structures, but analyzed using string operations and pattern matching. This design choice was necessary because manifest structures vary significantly across different Fiori app types (Fiori Elements V2/V4, freestyle apps, apps with extensions, etc.)

The class extracts:
- The main OData service name and URI
- The primary entity set used by the app
- OData version (V2 or V4)
- Data source configuration

### Class ZCL_FIORI_MODEL_ANALYZER
This is the core engine that performs the classification. For each app, it:

- Retrieves the manifest using the BSP application name
- Determines the OData version by checking SEGW projects (V2) or Service Bindings (V4)
- Resolves CDS views by reading the DDL source code:
    - Identifies the Consumption view (C_*)
    - Extracts the Interface view (I_*) from the FROM clause
- Classifies the programming model using multiple detection strategies:
    - RAP: Looks for root view entity, projections on R_* views, VDM consumption patterns
    - BOPF: Detects BOPF annotations (@ObjectModel.modelCategory: #BOPF, transactionalProcessingEnabled) by navigating through the CDS view hierarchy
    - N/A: Gateway Classic (non-managed scenarios)
- Detects FPM extensions by searching for controller/view extensions in the manifest

## What's next
- Improve *N/A* classification logic  
- Some SEGW Projects are not determined
- Validate accuracy across different S/4HANA releases  
- Analyzing Custom Fiori Apps: Support detection of custom Fiori Elements apps built with SAP Fiori Tools
